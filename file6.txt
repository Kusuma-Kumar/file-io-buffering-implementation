The machine then repeatedly scans left to right over the input. 
In each pass it erases the first symbol it sees marked with ' but remembers 
that symbol in its finite control (to "erase" really means to write the blank symbol u). 
It then scans forward until itsees the first symbol marked with " checks that that symbol is the same, and erases it. 
If the two symbols are not the same, it rejects. Otherwise, 
when it has erased all the symbols, it accepts. 
In our example, the following would be the tape contents after each pass.
