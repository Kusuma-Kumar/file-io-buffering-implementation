Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better
This Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together
This Christmas
The fireside is blazing bright, whoa-ah
We're caroling through the night, whoa-whoa
This Christmas will be a very special Christmas for me
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Ha, let's go (woo-hoo)
Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you
This Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town, they do
This Christmas
The fireside is blazing bright
And we're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah (huh)
Woah-oh, oh-oh
Oh, ha
Shake a hand, shake a hand now
Na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Ooh, the fireside is blazing bright
And we're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
So special for you and me
Yes, it will be
Woah-oh, oh, oh (ha)
Shake a hand y'all
Come on, everybody shake a hand y'all (ha)
Family, hey
We'll be together to make this Christmas bright
Yes, we will
