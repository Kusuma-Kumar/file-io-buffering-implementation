Your TM may make use of multiple tapes, with the assumption (shown in class)
that a multi-tape TM can be simulated with a single tape TM.
You do not have to give all of the transitions, but you should describe the
algorithm with sufficient detail--including how you will use the tape or tapes--to make it clear how it can be implemented in specific transitions. 
That is, give a high-level algorithm rather than the details of the transitions.
You may make use of the solution to HW15.
