Frosty the Snow'blahhhhs a jolly happy soul
With a cornblahhhhpe and a button nose
And two eyes mblahhhht of coal
Frosty the Snowman
blahhhhirytale, they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in
That old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Oh, Frosty, the Snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty, clumsy as he can be
See him lopping along
Off he goes on an icicle spree
With a happy song
Oh, Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, "Let's run, and we'll have some fun
Now, before I melt away"
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there
All around the square
Sayin', "Catch me if you can"
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, "Stop!"
Hmm, Frosty the Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye, sayin' "Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day"
Thumpety, thump thump, thumpety, thump thump
Look at Frosty go!
Thumpety, thump thump, thumpety, thump thump
Over the hills of snow!
